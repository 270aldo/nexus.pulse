# Resource Library

This document outlines the structure and usage of the resource library feature.

## Video metadata

Currently the UI displays the `duration_minutes` field on each card. To help users better choose content, consider storing and showing additional fields such as the video upload date and a difficulty level. These details can be surfaced on the cards alongside the duration so visitors can quickly gauge if a video suits their needs.
